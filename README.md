A game of numbers. More description to come

To play, select any combination of numbers that add up to the number of stars and click "=" to validate answer, and then click one more time to accept answer.
A number can be used once and becomes unavilable afterwards.
When a number is selected in error, it can be retrieved by simply clicking same number again.
When available numbers cannot add up to current number of stars, click on the redraw button with the refresh sign.
You only get five redraws.
If you're able to exhaust all numbers to represent a combination of the stars whilst having not maxed out redraws, you win.
If you run out of redraws, but still have some numbers left, you lose.
